## credits and appreciation

This basis for this setup was taken from ray-x, i loved the way it was layed out, i just felt that i needed to add more
towards the setup to get become more optimal, please refer to his setup or Maxes setup if mine breaks or does something
werid

- [Akinsho](https://github.com/akinsho/dotfiles/tree/nightly/.config/nvim)
  It would be an understatement to say that majority of my main / core functions come from his statement,
- [ray-x](https://github.com/ray-x/nvim)
  As stated above, the main layout and configs for lazy loading was taken from his setup.
- [Max](https://github.com/max397574/NeovimConfig)
  Maxes config is by far one of the nicest configs i have ever seen, his telescope config is amazing. Please check his
  config out.
- [Abz](https://github.com/abzcoding/nvim)
  Abz had amazing setup as well .

Also make sure you join [Neorg Discord](https://discord.gg/T6EgTAX7ht)

I have taken a large ammount of insperation - and well just yoinking stuff from a bunch of config, but the ones listed
above were the ones that made this possible.
