# Open Notice

Main Maintainer of this is Ray-X, i have just modified it and added extra Plugins: ALL CREDIT goes to him.
Thank you :



This neovim configure file is highly optimized for the impatient. Packer lazy loading + After syntax highlight rendering. Maybe the
only nvim setup in github that can render multiple files with treesitter in less than 80ms with ~110 plugins installed
(e.g. Open both util.lua(1686 loc) and lsp.lua(1538 loc) from neovim source code in 80.6ms)

The `Plug` config is located in branch [Plug branch](https://github.com/ray-x/dotfiles/tree/zprezto-plug)

- nvim+kitty configured with pop menu:

- nvim clap preview:

## Battery included

About 100 plugins and 1600 lines of lua and vim code.

## Neovim Plugins

There are lots of amazing plugins,
I used following plugin a lots

- `Plug` -> `Dein` -> `Lua-Packer`
  Change to Lua-Packer does not
  decrease startup time as Plug -> Dein. But still about 80ms faster for Golang codes loading.
  If you interested in Dein version, Please refer to [Dein](https://github.com/ray-x/dotfiles/tree/nvim-comple).
  This was the last Dein/Packer dual supports version I have (init.vim has a flag to choose).
  ATM, minium support for vim. Most plugins only works under neovim 0.5.0+.

  I followed Raphael(a.k.a glepnir) https://github.com/glepnir/nvim dotfiles. He provides a good wrapper for
  Packer. I have an `overwrite` folder which will override the settings. Also, lots of changes in modules/plugins.
  luarock setup
  A.T.M. nvim-compe/cmp as a completion engine with LSP, LSP saga. vim-multi-cursor, clap/telescope. treesitter,
  lazy load vim-go. So, other than module folder, I could copy/paste everything else from glepnir's configure file,
  which make my life easier.

- Telescope + Vim-Clap

  One of the best plugin for search anything. I used it to replace fzf, leaderF, leaderP, defx, Ag/Ack/Rg, yank(ring), project management. undolist and many more. Telescope is awesome, only issue is performance.

- nvim-lsp with [navigator.lua](https://github.com/ray-x/navigator.lua)

  I turn off vim-go auto-complete/LSP and turn to nvim-lsp. It adds around 200ms bootup time and some of the extensions
  might crash when I using coc (but it hard to check which becuase ~4 node.js services coc forked)
  Some useful script from TJ, and [glepnir](https://github.com/glepnir)

  nvim-tree: file-explorer (lightweight and fast)
  hrsh7th/nvim-cmp: auto-complete
  vsnip: code snipts(Load snippet from VSCode extension). It is a full featured IDE.

- ALE -> Efm

Lint and format moved to efm-server

- Programming support:
  Treesitter, nvim-lsp

  dlv, nvim-dap

  home cooked Aurora, windline (lua), devicons(lua), blankline(indent), bufferline

- Color:

  TokyoNight most likely


- Git:

  fugitive, nvimtree, gitsigns.nvim, VGit.nvim

- Format:

  tabular, lsp based code formating (or, sometimes prettier), auto-pair

- Menu and tab:

  - quickui(created a menu for the function/keybind I used less often. I can not remember all the commands and keybinds....)
    But Damn, I spend lots of time configuring it, however, it was used rarely. So I end up delete the plugin.
  - nvim-bufferline.lua: Yes, with lua and neovim only

- Tools: floatterm, scrollview

- Move and Edit:

  easymotion -> hop&lightspeed, vim-multi-cursor, navigator.lua (better treesitter folding), Sad for complex find and replace

# Startup nvim

If you saw error message "Error in packer_compiled: ..." Please press `Enter`, that will allow packer install the plugins.
After all plugins install restart the nvim.

Note:
The packages and data will be install to
`~/.local/share/nvim`

Please backup this folder if necessary

The setup should work with nvim0.5.1+ or nvim0.6+. A patched nerd font is needed. Also if you start nvim from terminal,
make sure it support nerdfont and emoji

## Configure

If you would like to sync to my branch. You can add you own setup in lua/overwrite folder

You can put your own plugins setup in `modules/user` folder

## Shell

- OhMyZshell is good, iterm2 is popular, but I turned to
  fish + spaceship + kitty. It is cooool and faster.
  nvim+kitty split view:

## Parking lots

These tools are good, but due to confliction, less use, or, not suite to my workflow

- vim/gvim
- YCM you complete me
- easymotion
- oh-my-zh, iterm2
- zpreztor
- rainbow
- defx
- ALE
