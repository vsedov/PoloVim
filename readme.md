# Setup
Yeah i couldnt care less about start up speeds, tbh, if it works, and its decent
for python and java, then all good.

The basic mapping for this setup was pretty much yoinked from glepnir setup.
with the options and pretty much everything else, though some extra stuff that
i have added.

Yes I use ale, ale provides two main features i cant really live without, decent
formating, aka python-black, while getting rid of stupid stuff on the side, and
nayvy, which was initially built for coc - though since the converison ive
realised i depend way way to much on it, such that i need it.

Lazy Load stuff, is not much of a priority as i said, speed doesnt matter all to
much to me.

Things that are unconventional:
  - Ale
  - Diagnostic Flake8- bunch of plugin support to match my linting style .
  - Debugging is still a bit broken

this setup tends to fail rather often due to updates or me being stupid, so
please be aware that this is not perfect.



Special Thanks to the following, whose setup helped me some what create this scuffed thing:
ray-x/nvim - His setup is amazing - though i prefer not to use navigator. 
glepnir/nvim - a good template that ray-x used, which i adopted . 



- Ive got so many binds that i sometimes dont even know if they work >.< 

In Any case, i will be making a documentation on everything really soon, for each function and class to make this more readble.
